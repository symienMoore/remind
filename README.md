## 📒 devlog/todo list
### 29-08-2025
I currently have the backend and front end deployed to fly,
I am going to get the backend api going first before focusing on ui. 
Also updated deployments.

### 30-08-2025
Made updates to the db files in SERVER, simplified some things
and am working to make it more managable.

### 02-09-2025
made some small changes to api models and routes, I need to start grouping routes,
add middleware and start working on authentication.

### 10-09-2025
made a small update to the landing page, I need to create a login or sign up form
and also diagram the flow of the application. I will be rolling my own auth for this
so I need to catch up on best practices.
